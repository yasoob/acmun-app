				The IAEA is responsible for the monitoring and regulation of any and all atomic research; from the development of nuclear weapons to the uses of radiation in treating diseases. It also serves to monitor experiments involving mutations. Such experiments are normally restricted to plants and animals due to moral and ethical reasons. However, in early 2014, North Korea's human mutation experiments were exposed after a large number of mutants rose up against the government. While the majority of these mutants do not possess exceptional abilities or blatant physical differences, they are both intellectually and physically superior to average humans. The conflict resulted with the north Korean government and the country's nuclear arsenal under mutant control. Now, these mutants have threatened to declare war on south Korea.
